# PwC Virtual Case Experience: Power BI in Data Analytics

This repository contains the dashboards for the 3 seperate tasks at ***[TheForage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/PwC-Digital-Up-skilling-Virtual-Case-Experience)***.

The real world datasets help you understand the business scenarios and steps to solve the business problems. These tasks empower you to identify patterns, risks and opportunities in data and turn it into convincing, actionable insights.

I've used Power BI and Power Query to build these dashboards.
